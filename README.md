# meteor-game

UPDATE (12Feb2019): this was my first attempt at OOP. Much of the code is repetitive and I learned alot from it; I have left this untouched so I can look back upon it later.

## Description

Meteor is a game wherein the user controls a UFO object, and attempts to survive as long as possible 
by avoiding contact with any flying meteors. The game ends upon contact with a meteor, and the player's
score is the time survived.
